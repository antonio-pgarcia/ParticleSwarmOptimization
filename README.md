ParticleSwarmOptimization
=========================

Particle swarm optimization is stochastic technique that randomly explores the problem solution space
in a resemblance of a bird flocking or particle movement. Method takes both, memory of individual
best position and the population global best positions, into account, as fitness criteria. It claims to
solve complex optimization problems with a very simple algorithm.
